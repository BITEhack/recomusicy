96,Let My Home Be My Gallows,Hans Zimmer,soundtrack,3.0800000000000005,3.415,"Agnus dei, agnus dei, agnus dei, agnus dei Agnus dei, agnus dei, agnus dei, agnus dei  Because of his avarice, and his betrayal of the emperor's trust, Pier della Vigna was disgraced, blinded, and imprisoned. Dante's pilgrim finds Pier della Vigna on the seventh level of the Inferno. Like Judas Iscariot, he died by hanging. But Judas and Pier della Vigna are linked in Dante by the avarice he saw in them. In fact avarice and hanging are linked in the medieval mind Now this is the earliest known depiction of the Crucifixion, carved on an ivory box in Gaul, about A.D. 400. It includes the death by hanging of Judas, his face upturned to the branch that suspends him. Here he is again on the doors of the Benevento cathedral, hanging. This time with his bowels falling out Now on this plate from the fifteenth-century edition of the Inferno Pier della Vigna's body hangs from a bleeding tree. I will not belabour the obvious parallel with Judas Iscariot, but Dante Alighieri needed no drawn illustration: It is his genius to make Pier della Vigna, now in Hell, speak in strained hisses and coughing sibilants as though he is hanging still Come l'altre verrem per nostre spoglie Ma non però ch'alcuna sen rivesta Ché non è giusto aver ciò ch'om si toglie Qui le trascineremo, e per la mesta Selva saranno i nostri corpi appesi Ciascuno al prun de l'ombra sua molesta Avarice, hanging, self destruction Io fei gibbetto a me le mie case Make my own home be my gallows"

I'm dreaming of bouncing feet and your motherly smile But when you're sleeping so far away I can't feel what's inside How am I still holding on? Oh God I hope I am holding She'll try and describe what my strength provides but I fear my strength is failing If I could change my mind I would change What's the change for the better For a child who learns not to cry? And to the boy who relies on his anger: You'll survive but you won't feel exchange And why all these doubts? And what are all these doubts? I see in her eyes that I'm holding her fine but all I'm hearing is doubts Even as water's crushing over my head And the rhythm that I would slow is picking up it's pace I'm learning from older shames as I'm watching them die And I'm still hoping to see her smile in the morning when we wake Now that I am waking up Oh God I hope I am waking Though I'm overwhelmed at times I find that I'm less afraid of change Change all the time I'm still finding what's sure And not getting lost in my mind I know I can try Needing my own But still Getting lost in her eyes And hoping it's time Wide eyed I get wide eyed

210,The Donner Party,Rasputina,steampunk,5.6925,4.38,"The similarities and situation between the Donner Party and the Colonial Pilgrims is both appalling, frightening, and incomplete. In both cases, you'll find one: a fairly large group of ill-prepared greenhorns pitting themselves against nature and each other; two: an insufficient willingness to endure the very real hardships of frontiering, and three: coincidental misfortune at every turn Disasters of both camps were initially brought about by departure, delay, desert, inertia; which caused our heroes to begin their journeys at absolutely retarded times weather- wise. If fantasy is the refuge of a frightened man, and a castle in the air is a safe harbor for a foolish few, just imagine living in a hut buried twelve feet below the snow, with the sight and smell of the scattered carcasses of loved ones at your feet; it is the lay of the land, just another day. I would like to propose that cannibalism was indeed rampant among America's earliest settlers: The Pilgrims. For what does settler imply, if not the willingness to settle? To settle for a meal of human flesh if my thoughts on the subject are to be believed. In conclusion, spread the word of this. Look to the night sky, and hark back to our forefathers' shortcomings, (and your own), as you cut your meat and lay the groundwork for a new tomorrow"

533,The Story,Bun B,hip-hop,5.57,3.38," Say, this is the realist shit I ever wrote or said Wake up with it everyday and take it with me to bed Hurting my heart and hanging over my head Bout the realest nigga these Texas streets ever bred C.L. Butler better known as Chad or Pimp C The closest homeboy that I ever had Now when we first met, we wasn't on the same page From petty misunderstandings that got clearer with age Two young boys who was ready to mash Put P.A. on the map and maybe make a little cash Jumped down with Bigtyme, put down a few songs Everybody co-signed saying that we could do no wrong Then hit the streets with a big ass bang Them gangsta ass rhymes with that country ass twang Dropped Tell Me Something Good took off and went live Shit, next thing you know we was signing to Jive Dropped Too Hard to Swallow, A Pocket Full of Stones Put the remix on ""Menace"" shit we had it going on Got love in the streets and played on the air But the homey putting us out, wasn't playing too fair Had to separate ourself, bring in a new team But sometimes the other side ain't always what it seems We dropped ""Super Tight"" a album full of killer flows But then we got caught up with the drugs and the hoes We didn't realize what was happening on the real And new management was cutting back room deals Hiding different money and concealing the price He had us doing all the work but was keeping the biggest slice Took a while to catch on, to what homey was doing But by the time we did, all the paperwork was in ruins Nigga kept all the receipts so we couldn't file taxes The next thing you know, IRS hitting us with axes Pimp you owe seven figures, Bun you owe six Better get your paper together, get this shit fixed Remixed the management team and tried it ourself Cussed out the GM, almost got put on the shelf Fuck it, dropped ""Ridin' Dirty"" instant classic in the South Reclaimed the southern title, shut everybody's mouth Got some clout in the game, boys calling us the greatest But meanwhile me and Pimp is still ducking haters The old manager calling and say he fina' sue And put a padlock on the everything we trying to do Put a call out to the Prince, this nigga still hating We got heat for the streets, and we can't keep the people waiting He made a call or two to some folks, tellin' 'em, man You gotta cut UGK some slack understand Young Pimp got the plan, Bun got the drawl Rap-A-Lot had our back and we just waiting on Jive We got the big bosses on the same page So me and young Pimp went hit 'em from center stage Next thing you know we got this call from the N.Y It's Jay-Z saying y'all niggas getting fly He doing ""Volume 3"" and got a track from Timb And wondered could some trill niggas rock it with him Shit big Bun was all for it, but Pimp wasn't sure But ""Big Pimpin"" hit 'em 187-Pure Number one song on every station you turn on MTV and BET we getting our burn on Grammy nominated can't believe that we made it And we got a call from Jive that left us all faded And it stated, that due to the success of the track We here at Jive records, would like to piggy back Get another beat from Timb, then get a verse from Jay Let Hype shoot the video and we'll be on the way Shit it sounded okay, but me I had to ask If we don't do Big Pimpin 2, would you still put us on blast A song like that would might take a nigga to the top But my true fan base, might think a nigga flop They got mad and put niggas on hold For damn near a year till the buzz got cold So we said fuck 'em and went back to the basics Trying to find ways to get the fuck up out the matrix We put ""Dirty Money"" together and it was aces But that's around the time that Pimp caught two cases He got probation, said fuck you hoes We finish the album, got ready to do a couple shows And then he violated, one month before we dropped And shit just got put on hold or fucking stopped Now 30 days done, we back to the nitty gritty Album got released, big showdown in Chocolate City Niggas with masks on, vests and all black It's Christmas 2001, bitch we was all that Strongest on the block, nobody could budge And then he violated, now we right back before the judge They calling him a nuisance, put my dog behind a fence It was January 28th, he ain't been home since Threw a nigga through a loop and caught me in the crosses (In)'stead of co-CEO, now I'm the fuckin boss Had the devil on my back, got to drinking and drugging Had to make a choice, get back to rapping or thugging So I walked into my bedroom, got down on my knees Put my hands together and I prayed Lord please Let me get past this bridge over water that's trouble And get back up on my grind on the double He said son don't worry Cause it's not really hard as it seem And I can turn your nightmares back into dreams You just got to stay true to yourself and to ‘C Then push away from the devil and get closer to me And every since that night man I promise I been on it Giving that killer flow to anybody who want it Pimp the pen like never before, I'm breaking 'em G Not to mention I got the world screaming ""Free Pimp C"" So soon as you make parole and they open the doors You ain't gotta worry about nothing, the world is yours Ain't no mo' struggles my nigga and no mo' strife I kept it real because to me it's UGK for life"

Man got game like a motherfucker) True indeed, fuck it, Jihad In the eight century Muslims conquered Spain, Portugal and France and controlled it for 700 years They never mention this in history class 'Cause ofays are threatened when you get the real lesson Moors from Baghdad, Turkey threatened European Christians Meaning, the white way of life; hence the Crusades for Christ On November 25th, 1491 Santiago defeats the last Muslim stronghold, Granada King Ferdinand gave thanks to God for victory And the Pope of Rome and declared this date to forever be A day of ""Thanksgiving"" for all European Christians Now listen, when you celebrate ""Thanksgiving"" What you are actually celebrating Is the proclamation of the Pope of Rome Who later, in league with Queen Isabella Sent Cardinal Ximenos to Spain To murder any blacks that resisted Christianity These Moors, these black men and women were from Baghdad, Turkey And today, you eat the turkey for your ""Thanksgiving"" day As the European powers destroyed the Turkeys Who were the forefathers of your mothers and fathers Now fight the power, bitch-ass niggas Now around this time, whites started callin' us Negroes That's Spanish for ""black object"" meaning we're not really people But property, and the triangle trade begins - they seize us Queen Elizabeth sends the first slaves on a ship named Jesus Stealin' land from the indigenous natives Gave them alcohol to keep the Red Man intoxicated Whites claim they had to civilize these pagan animals But up until 1848 there's documented cases Of whites being the savage cannibals, eating Indians In 1992, it's Jeffery Dahmer They slaughtered a whole race with guns Drugs, priests and nuns 1763, the first demonic tactic of biological warfare As tokens of peace, Sir Jeffery Amherst Passed out clothing and blankets to the Indian community Infested with small pox, knowing they had no immunity Today it's AIDS, you best believe it's man made 'Cause ain't a damn thing changed, let me explain Now since people of color are genetically dominant And Caucasoids are genetically recessive And whites expect to be predominant, meaning survive as a race then They simply must take precautions That's why they're worried about their future now 'Cause by 2050 almost all the Earth's population will be brown Then black, so understandin' that, whites counter-react (Man I'm saying, the fools ain't nothing but a teaspoon of milk in a world coloured with joy) So they created a system To force blacks into an unnatural position That re-enforces the position of natural inferiority In addition, created guns and developed the ethnocentric view That God justifies every fuckin' thing they do Condition people to perceive whites' culture as civilized And every other culture considered primitive - not true Racism is the system of racial subjugation against non-whites In every areas of human relation Entertainment, education, labor, politics Law, religion, sex, war and economics See blacks were 3/5ths of a man with tax purposes intended You think you're Afro-American? You're a 14th amendment and a good nigga Jews don't salute the fuckin' swastika But niggas pledge allegiance to the flag that accosted ya They never teach about the break of islands like Jamaica But before slaves came here whites would take a Pregnant woman, hang her from a tree by her toes Slice her stomach with a knife and let the unborn baby fall to the flo' And stomp an unborn child in front of all the slaves To inbreed fear, so they'd be scared and behave And not rebel more Understand all whites must be perceived as potential predators I paraphrase historian Ishakamusa Barashango ""Understand that, regardless of the lofty ideas engraved on paper in such documents as the Constitution or Declaration, the basic nature of the European American white man remains virtually unchanged"" So, check This is the nature of the threat"

You know what, I can't bring my kids up in a church whose authority system is entirely based on the size of fucking hats, okay? That's apparently how the Catholic church is run. The bigger the hat, the more important the guy, right? Priests have no hats, cardinals have those little red beanies, the pope has a collection of big hats... God must have a HUGE fucking sombrero up in heaven, huh? ""Look at me, I'm God! Look at the size of my hat, who else would I be?"" ""I don't know, lead singer of Los Lobos? I don't know!

They just change the rules for no reason, like God just called up on the hotline. Remember Saint Christopher? They kicked him out, he's not a saint anymore, you know that? Yeah, Saint Christopher, the patron saint of travel. When we were growing up, your parents would have that Saint Christopher figurine magnetic thing that was on the dashboard when you were driving around. Now he's gone, they kicked him out. ""Fuck ya!

I see no light inside the darkness So whatcha want, miss? don't check my pulse because i'm heartless You were my life support. And in a sense my defense fights the thought I'll try to keep this one nice and short Our four chambers beat in unison I'm wanting you to listen to the dead silence in my defiance I used to sin and be intrigued by violence Now as I glimpse into the past I thank God for your guidance Alas, I give my eyes a rinse Blink and think in retrospect...realize you need to get your respect I apologize as I holler cries Cause it's you and not these college guys that keeps my knowledge wise You're my crutch. but now I fall cause you're someone i can't touch Now no one wants to help me up and that's too much Even my wisdom fell. i'm in a living hell Throw my inner child back in the prison cell Incarcerated hatred is causing conflict With the free love sentencing death to the convict My soul is on skid row, where can this kid go? I'm homeless, how could you notice when this whole world didn't know? It's time i make public just how personal we got in private moments Because lies are our opponents Forget material or superficial stuff I either let you know too much or not enough This is to the woman who i loved but lost Intertwined souls of the universe got divorced But it wasn't forced. got single thoughts Of being double crossed, still there's no love lost. There's no love lost I can't pretend this. The impact on my life has been tremendous It can't be fixed with a friendly kiss What's endless? Questions, pain, grief and misbelief? I'm so faithful all I grind is my teeth But what I find beneath the surface has changed from priceless to worthless This three ring circus of clowning around is what hurts us My brain short circuits as my mind starts to wander To discover another lover. I'm isolated, living somber She's whispering ""come hither from there yonder."" I don't think i wanna. The pressure ain't gettin' lesser Open my dresser...it overflows with memorabilia Momentos of our success now symbolize my failure I took time to write you diaries when we couldn't speak much According to you that was a weak touch Cause ""actions speak louder than words."" Turn up your hearing aid You made this man afraid. Put the pin back in the hand grenade There's not much time left til I'm left with nothing but a broken promise While every syllable I said was spoken honest We expected each other to be a physic mind reader Don't tell me ""life goes on."" I need her... Next to me... So once again I can feel the high of ecstasy... We tripped...walking down the aisle of destiny Respectful sexually, because see...I understood And I don't know too many people who would Have done anything to get a laugh from their better half I should have sensed it sooner...when you lost your sense of humor Now let my soul speak, I couldn't eat for a whole week With no sleep. The price I pay for being a control freak Now I'm screaming inside my pillow instead of dreaming I must have said ""I love you"" so much that it lost it's meaning But no one's perfect, so where's my chance to make adjustments? It's worth it...if our romance had substance Because with purity we conceived marriage Til insecurity caused a miscarriage This is to the woman who i loved but lost Intertwined souls of the universe got divorced But it wasn't forced. got single thoughts of being double crossed... I was in it for the long run Now who's the weak and the strong one? I tried to be Mr. Right, though things were wrongly done But ummmm...When it was time for sacrifice Straight up, you didn't have to ask me twice I put off this rap device I wasn't ACTING nice, all my feelings they were genuine You got me open and I let you in But now you're screaming bloody murder. Used the entrance as the exit Now you're absent like my mind, i'm on a head trip You never said shit. Used then misused the entrance And never let me get in one sentence Forget friends...you were my best one Now I'm depressed, son. It didn't take long for the stress to come Memories be my arch nemesis As i sit and reminisce, wondering if you remember this: Our genesis. First experiences on old dates Got cold shakes and tingles, never single, we were soulmates That term used to hold weight but now it's temporary And lately I've been making trips to the cemetery Ain't nothing evil in death, but this feels devilish I'd never wish this on my worst enemy Remember me"

Pack it in, I heard you did, pack it in Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win?  So lately you've been hidin', it was somewhere in the news And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues And a voice calls out the numbers and it sometimes mentions mine And I feel like I've been workin' overtime Over time, I've lost my fire over time Always playin' one more hand for one more dime Slowin' down, I'm gettin' tired, slowin' down And I envy you the valley that you've found  Cause I'm midway down the midway Slowin' down Down, down, down"

1568,The Christmas Guest,Johnny Cash,rock,6.32,3.23," It happened one day near December's end Two neighbors called on an old friend And they found his shop so meager and lean Made gay with thousand bows of green And Conrad was sitting with face a-shine When he suddenly stopped as he stitched a twine And he said ""Old friends, at dawn today When the cock was crowing the night away The Lord appeared in a dream to me And said ""I'm coming your guest to be."" So I've been busy with feet astir Strewing my shop with branches of fern The table is spread and the kettle is shined And over the rafters the holly is twined Now I'll wait for my Lord to appear And listen closely so I will hear His step as He nears my humble place And I'll open the door and look on His face So his friends went home and left Conrad alone For this was the happiest day he had known For long since, his family had passed away And Conrad had spent many a sad Christmas Day But he knew with the Lord as his Christmas Guest This Christmas would be the dearest and best So he listened with only joy in his heart And with every sound he would rise with a start And look for the Lord to be at his door Like the vision he had had a few hours before So he ran to the window after hearing a sound But all he could see on the snow covered ground Was a shabby beggar whose shoes were torn And all of his clothes were ragged and worn But Conrad was touched and he went to the door And he said, ""You know, your feet must be frozen and sore I have some shoes in my shop for you And a coat that will keep you warmer too."" So with grateful heart the man went away But Conrad noticed the time of day And wondered what made the Lord so late And how much longer he'd have to wait When he heard a knock, he ran to the door But it was only a stranger once more A bent old lady with a shawl of black With a bundle of kindling piled on her back She asked for only a place to rest But that was reserved for Conrad's Great Guest But her voice seemed to plead ""Don't send me away Let me rest for awhile on Christmas Day"" So Conrad brewed her a steaming cup And told her to sit at the table and sup But after she left he was filled with dismay For he saw that the hours were slipping away And the Lord hadn't come as he said he would Then Conrad felt sure he had misunderstood When out of the stillness he heard a cry ""Please help me and tell me where am I?"" So again he opened his friendly door And stood disappointed as twice before It was only a child who'd wandered away And was lost from her family on Christmas Day Again Conrad's heart was heavy and sad But he knew he should make the little girl glad So he called her in and he wiped her tears And quieted all her childish fears Then he led her back to her home once more But as he entered his own darkened door He knew the Lord was not coming today For the hours of Christmas had passed away So he went to his room and knelt down to pray And he said ""Dear Lord, why did you delay? What kept you from coming to call on me? For I wanted so much your face to see."" When soft in the silence a voice he heard ""Lift up your head for I kept my word Three times my shadow crossed your floor And three times I came to your lonely door I was the beggar with bruised, cold feet And I was the woman you gave something to eat I was the child on the homeless street Three times I knocked, and three times I came in And each time I found the warmth of a friend Of all the gifts, love is the best And I was honored to be your Christmas Guest"

Tell your friends what you have heard, show them all the lies unlearned  And when you really go, you will really know you were never meant for Earth What's it worth?

Sing if you're glad to be gay Sing if you're happy that way  Pictures of naked young women are fun In Titbits and Playboy, page three of The Sun There's no nudes in Gay News, our one magazine But they still find excuses to call it obscene Read how disgusting we are in the press The Telegraph, People and Sunday Express Molesters of children, corruptors of youth It's there in the paper, it must be the truth (Try and) Sing if you're glad to be gay Sing if you're happy that way (Hey!) Sing if you're glad to be gay Sing if you're happy that way  Don't try to kid us that if you're discreet You're perfectly safe as you walk down the street You don't have to mince or make bitchy remarks To get beaten unconscious and left in the dark I had a friend who was gentle and short He was lonely one evening and went for a walk Queerbashers caught him, kicked in his teeth He was only hospitalised for a week (And he still bears the scars)  Sing if you're glad to be gay Sing if you're happy that way (Hey!) Sing if you're glad to be gay Sing if you're happy that way  And sit back and watch as they close down our clubs Arrest us for meeting and raid all our pubs Make sure your boyfriend's at least 21 So only your friends and your brothers get done Lie to your workmates, lie to your folks Put down the queens, tell anti-queer jokes Gay Lib's ridiculous, join their laughter 'The buggers are legal now, what more are they after?' (Tell them!) Sing if you're glad to be gay Sing if you're happy that way (Hey!) Sing if you're glad to be gay Sing if you're happy that way Sing if you're glad to be gay Sing if you're happy that way (Hey!) Sing if you're glad to be gay Sing if you're happy this way"

2016,The Highwayman,Loreena McKennitt,celtic,3.8928767123287673,4.631643835616439,"The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon the cloudy seas The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor And the highwayman came riding Riding, riding The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door He'd a French cocked hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin A coat of claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin; They fitted with never a wrinkle; his boots were up to the thigh! And he rode with jeweled twinkle His pistol butts a-twinkle His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jeweled sky And o'er the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard And he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred; He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there But the landlord's black-eyed daughter Bess, the landlord's daughter Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair ""One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I'm after a prize tonight But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light; Yet if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day Then look for me by the moonlight Watch for me by the moonlight I'll come to thee by the moonlight, though hell should bar the way He rose up right in the stirrups; he scarce could reach her hand But she loosened her hair in the casement! His face burnt like a brand As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast; And he kissed its waves in the moonlight (Oh, sweet waves in the moonlight!) Then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the west He did not come at the dawning; he did not come at noon And out of the tawny sunset, before the rise o' the moon When the road was a gypsy's ribbon, looping the purple moor A red-coat troop came marching Marching, marching King George's men came marching, up to the old inn-door They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead But they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed; Two of them knelt at the casement, with muskets at their side! There was death at every window Hell at one dark window; For Bess could see, through the casement the road that he would ride They had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest; They had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast! ""Now keep good watch!"" and they kissed her. She heard the dead man say ""Look for me by the moonlight Watch for me by the moonlight I'll come to thee by the moonlight, though hell should bar the way!"" She twisted her hands behind her, but all the knots held good! She writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood! They stretched and strained in the darkness and the hours crawled on by like years! Till, now, on the stroke of midnight Cold, on the stroke of midnight The tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers! Tot-a-lot tot-a-lot! Had they heard it? The horse-hoofs ringing clear Tot-a-lot tot-a-lot, in the distance! Were they deaf that they did not hear? Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill The highwayman came riding Riding, riding! The red-coats looked to their priming! She stood up straight and still Tot-a-lot in the frosty silence! Tot-a-lot, in the echoing night! Nearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light! Her eyes grew wide for a moment! She drew one last deep breath Then her finger moved in the moonlight Her musket shattered the moonlight Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him with her death He turned; he spurred to the west; he did not know she stood Bowed, with her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood! Not till the dawn he heard it; his face grew grey to hear How Bess, the landlord's daughter The landlord's black-eyed daughter Had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there And back, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky With a white rope smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high! Blood-red were the spurs i' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat When they shot him down on the highway Down like a dog on the highway And he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat Still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees When the moon is a ghostly galleon, tossed upon the cloudy seas When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor The highwayman comes riding Riding, riding The highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door"

See... onward she comes Onward she nears, out of the sun See, she has no crew She has no life, wait but there's two  Death and she Life-in-Death They throw their dice for the crew She wins the Mariner and he belongs to her now  Then... crew one by one They drop down dead, two hundred men She... she, Life-in-Death She lets him live, her chosen one   ""One after one by the star-dogged Moon Too quick for groan or sigh Each turned his face with a ghastly pang And cursed me with his eye Four times fifty living men And I heard nor sigh nor groan With heavy thump, a lifeless lump They dropped down one by one.""  The curse it lives on in their eyes The Mariner he wished he'd die Along with the sea creatures But they lived on, so did he  And by the light of the Moon He prays for their beauty not doom With heart he blesses them God's creatures all of them too  Then the spell starts to break The Albatross falls from his neck Sinks down like lead into the sea Then down in falls comes the rain, hahaha   Hear the groans of the long-dead seamen See them stir and they start to rise Bodies lifted by good spirits None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes  And revenge still is sought, penance starts again Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on  Now the curse is finally lifted And the Mariner sights his home Spirits go from the long-dead bodies Form their own light and the Mariner's left alone   And then a boat came sailing towards him It was a joy he could not believe The Pilot's boat, his son, and the Hermit Penance of life will fall onto him  And the ship, it sinks like lead into the sea And the Hermit shrieves the Mariner of his sins  The Mariner's bound to tell of his story To tell this tale wherever he goes To teach God's word by his own example That we must love all things that God made  And the Wedding guest's a sad and wiser man And the tale goes on and on and on and on"

2237,Magician's Assistant,Dan Le Sac vs Scroobius Pip,spoken word,4.486666666666666,3.995," It's tragic, you tried to cut yourself in half But this ain't magic In fact it's something far more dark, or more dramatic Self harm, that's what they call it Cause it just affects you It's your life, your body, so you can choose what you do And if one day you can't reign it in And of your last breath you are the only witness Then so be it, cause it's your last breath And it's nobody else's business But, how about your little sister? I mean, you think your life's been bad And by no means am I belittling that Cause I know the troubles you've had But a teen finding out her big sister chose death over life Finding out instead of turning to her with your problems, You turned to a knife That's a whole lot of pain to deal with And a whole lot of damage And the only role model she has now is little more than words engraved in granite But as you said before, this just affects you It's your life, your body, so you can choose what you do And if one day you can't reign it in And of your last breath you are the only witness Then so be it, cause it's your last breath And it's nobody else's business But then, how about your parents? God knows they've done all they can to support Yeah, you didn't grow up in a mansion But they gave you the best life they could afford And the second that last bit of life trickles out And your lungs cease to breath They've failed the most important task that they will ever receive They failed to give their child a life that's worth living And that's a failure as long as they live, of themselves, is unforgiving But as you said before, this just affects you It's your life, your body, so you can choose what you do And if one day you can't rein it in And of your last breath you are the only witness Then so be it, cause it's your last breath And it's nobody else's business But, how about your friends? How did they fail to see this coming? I mean, you can only hold so much pain And recently it seems like the tap's been left running Families grow distant, but it's meant to be your friends you can rely on They shouldn't be there for just fun and drinks They should be the shoulder to cry on They should be the ones you turn to When you can't talk to your family But they failed to because although you didn't ask for their support It should have been mandatory But as you said before, this just affects you It's your life, your body, so you can choose what you do And if one day you can't rein it in And of your last breath you are the only witness Then so be it, cause it's your last breath And it's nobody else's business But then, what about me? What kind of boyfriend am I? Instead of living a life I was a big part of You would rather die Instead of fighting though together And turning things around You decided the grass is greener On the other side of the ground Of our shared lives there was nothing worth living for as far as you could see So if that's the case for you Then what is there left in this life for me? But as you said before, this just affects you It's your life, your body, your sister, your parents, your friends, and your partner So you can choose what you do And if one day you can't rein it in And of your last breath you are the only witness Then fuck everybody else cause that ain't something you’ve got to live with The magician's assistant Too many problems to list them Not enough people to listen The magician's assistant....

2358,Ebony And Ivy,Esperanza Spalding,dance,7.39,5.85625," Ochre, ivy, brick, and leather bound books built up by heavy lock crooks with unburdened minds of bastardized Darwinian logic projected as hard evidence on backs and faces of our ancestral culprits wasted, toiling as a majority of plantated crimes We wanna knock  and climb  strings of wisdom and build our own hot breath kingdoms and make humane passions rain down ash then hand out dirty white rules to wipe up and memorize then howl our own law hand-me-downs upon the class of masses and grin as each graduate passes on our synthesized words that sterilize natural awe  Sage grows on the mountain You can dig it with a silver spoon Float it off to market Hawk and talk it from hot-air balloons Get your good old-fashioned learning Hear the bell in summers Ending underneath the apple tree Time to choose a branch And build your nest of animosity Now we're really, really learning  It's been hard to grow outside Growing good, and act happy And pretend that the ivy vines Didn't weigh our branch down It's been hard to grow outside But we're finally happy Where the sage on the mountain now Is a plant or animal Sage grows on the mountain 'round the fountain of unfiltered truth Someone's locked the well You might contaminate their point-of-view And the taste of high-class feelings Peeking through the keyhole Thirsty people watch the mastery One degree of kneeling separates the heads from loving need And the art of low-class feeling  It's been hard to grow outside Growing good, and act happy And pretend that the ivy vines Didn't weigh our branch down It's been hard to grow outside But we're finally happy Where the sage on the mountain now Is a plant or animal  Finally.
