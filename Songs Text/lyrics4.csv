Yeah, but I don't mind that beat, 'cause it's a melody. Muse, divine me an art and buy me an artistry. See, I will give you every lonely piece of me and never want for mine I am all out of time, I'm all out of you too This is my best impression of how the innocent crawl. Walk to run first or first stand then fall. Just remember the real course, and driving is easier pursued by the second hand. And this is my best impression of going belly high, see me don't give in, don't give up, do I? No. I am defiant of the factory molds and the fate proven partially blind. Call it the circle made whole, get what the beast deserves or whatever you want my friend, it's just if I'm hard to see, then it's hard to breathe. I've got a pulse that won't pretend, that I don't mind that beat, 'cause it's a melody. Muse, divine me an art and buy me an artistry. I will give you every lonely piece of me and never want for mine I am all out of time, I'm all out of you too This is my unreasonable demon soothed. One possible dream removed. My challenge to fill the room by one silent voice--improved. An empty victory don't bother me by the loss, I'll be a little less empty when I've recovered the cost of the page--ever curious, divine and delirious, my invective invested is inviting a series of axioms to list: don't count your love by the kiss, your fame by the risk, don't own the boast over the bliss.

So what's a terrorist?

Remote-controlled drones killing off human lives Or man with home-made bomb committing suicide?

While outside, the wild boars root Without bending a bough underfoot — O it breaks my heart; I don't know how they do it So don't ask me! And as for my inflammatory writ? Well, I wrote it and I was not inflamed one bit Advice from the master derailed that disaster; He said ""Hand that pen over to me, poetaster!""

All I did was put it in music, kicked the truth in my lyrics And I never abused it Cause I never was stupid enough to overdo it 'Til the message was useless Setup the booth with delivery and some courage Even if was nervous; I would go and spit with a purpose I knew the stakes were high That they would come with the king I knew my ace was high Higher than the queen or the jack to grace the sky On third base I'm trying to take home if the outfielder takes the fly I'm Greydon Square, I'm way ahead a' ya These other rappers rhyme repetitive I'm Kirk Franklin's quantum negative I don't believe in your god because there's no evidence But these theists actually believe their own rhetoric Making songs, there's like six rappers that I'm taking on The new fad: attack the atheist rappers the break is on They knew we gonna keep rapping 'til the break of dawn Me, Proclaim, Syqnys, Jayez Dallas and Mr. Gawn, P Funk and Reggie Von And for the record; I'm still rational response If you want to take it there we can take it there I'm not hard to find you can Google Greydon Square It is what it is, walking Stephen Hawking, black Carl Sagan The logistical native host of atheist nation Giving atheist the safest of havens While at the same time Fighting irrationality with Brian Sapient Within my music, and I'm taping it So who else can say their taking this fight where I'm taking it? Unwelcome in the bible belt; they say they gon' kill me I'm a threat, the new Hewie Newton, you feel me? I give a damn about money, even less about fame Ever since I became an atheist; everything changed And that's real, while I'm tryna spread truth; These other rappers are trying to catch females and stack bills I'm a welcome change in the industry But all the sacrilegious rabble-rousing Has made me a few enemies If hell existed, I'd probably be going But since it doesn't I'ma keep on rolling like neighborhood nineties These rappers spit for the club to get a quicker buck Praying to the same Jesus Christ Adolf Hitler was Christianity was a great idea But it was poorly executed if neo-nazis can use it Lets call it what it was; attempted genocide Seeing your enemies faces, but through religious eyes Now my own people starting to hate me Because I showed how they wouldn't believe in this god if it wasn't for slavery It would probably be Colombo or ra,  or niamie a ma It's Greydon Your friendly neighborhood heathen Serving these theists rationality and reason This is the Compton effect  X 2 He doesn't believe in what we believe in we can make him And we gonna do whatever it takes to break him And if he doesn't break then we have to slay him While asking our invisible friend: please save him (Greydon) A, is it straight?

You know we have more prescription drugs now Every commercial that comes on TV is a prescription drug ad I can't watch TV for four minutes without thinking I have five serious diseases Like: ""Do you ever wake up tired in the mornings?"" Oh my god, I have this! Write this down. Whatever it is, I have it Half the time I don't even know what the commercial is: There's people running in fields or flying kites or swimming in the ocean Like: ""That is the greatest disease ever. How do you get that? That disease comes with a hot chick and a puppy.""

He's going to waste the money Well, he lives in a box, what do you want him to do? Save it up and buy a wall unit? Take a little run to the store for a throw rug and a CD rack? He's homeless! I walked behind this guy the other day. A homeless guy asked him for money He looks right at the homeless guy and goes: ""Why don't you go get a job, you bum?"" People always say that to homeless guys, ""Get a job"", like it is always that easy This homeless guy was wearing his underwear outside his pants I'm guessing his resume ain't all up to date I'm predicting some problems during the interview process I'm pretty sure even McDonald's has a ""Underwear Go Inside The Pants"" policy Not that they enforce it really strictly, but technically, I'm sure it is on the books Sing, sing, sing...

You can stumble through the stars You can choke on a snow flake You can slip on a banana peel to death So spake the hopeless ape You can get struck by a lightning bolt A lightning bolt doesn't know its own strength You'll pull a purr out of her if it kills you Just you wait  Aren't babies born with creases in their palms Way before you think the hand's most frequent movements have been established? Have humans evolved to be born to hold hammers and swords? In the years to come, will we see the emergence of a strong computer key finger? In the years to come, will we see a flattened mouse pad palm?"

I always played my hand Like I didn't have the cards Cause he held them all So I could never see Yes, he played me for a fool And I agreed And the closing credits roll And the waves come in like thunder Cause the hero's lost control And I made a fatal blunder Just another sad story; Two star-crossed kids Racing headlong up a cul-de-sac And then that music That mournful music And the train's disappearing Down that railroad track And the long, slow dissolve As we fade to black"

2427,The Story of Aina,Aina,symphonic metal,6.32,3.2299999999999995,"Our setting is the peaceful land of Aina, a wondrous and prospering country with beautiful people. All had lived in happiness and sunlight for as long as anyone could remember or learn in history from far, far back in the ages. There had been only an echo of a rumour of a legend of an evil deity, and black, desperate souls living in a barren place of existence too far away to matter. Then suddenly one day, the Divinities sent down a warning to the Oracles. The three readers stood before their King, King Taetius Ainaen, aghast and ashen with the news of visions of violent and desolate scenes forthcoming in their lands. But the mighty King just laughed at their worries, reminded them they had never known anything but peace and prosperity. The Silver Maiden, Oria Allyahan, fairest in all of time and being was loved and adored by many, but namely in secret by Torek Ainaen, Prince and future King of Aindahaj. But Talon, brother of Torek, also pined for her affections unbeknownst to anyone in the land. On the very day that Torek was making arrangements and gathering up the courage to proclaim the fair Oria as his choice for future Queen, Talon happily announces that he Oria are deeply in love and are to wed ere the month's end. Torek goes to Oria, begging to know if it's true. She says that it is indeed, whereupon he professes his love, asking her to be his bride. She refuses, saying she loves Talon, not he, powerful though his position may be. Furious and heartbroken, Torek storms out of the Castle of Ainaen, never again to be seen. Filled with ever-blackening rage, Torek sets out and travels far beyond the known realms. He finally comes to rest in a forsaken land where a hideous breed of creature dwell: the Krakhôn. They immediately name him their Lord, as they believed in and worshipped the evil god Sorvahr, and believed him to look as Torek did upon his arrival; mean and bloated with the menacing power of hatred burning in his eyes. There they bore him gifts and build him a towering fortress of cold metal that sucked away warmth or beauty out of its surroundings. This new home he chose to nurse the great hatred growing within him, destined as his empire, he named Naschtok. As time goes by, his hatred mounts, along with his desire for revenge. And as his harted grows, his body swells to accommodate it and he becomes a great and evil beast of profound strength and terrifying menace, becoming unrecognizable to any who once knew and loved him as Torek, Prince of Aina. He becoms Sorvahr, god of blackness and destruction. He nurtures the grotesque and horrific Krakhôn, making of them a loyal army of deadly force. The day comes many years from when he dissapeared from Aina when he marches his armies there, destroying much and killing many, brutalizing and defiling his once beloved land and people. But his eye is on the Castle Ainaen, where his brother Talon now rules as King - and Oria. He storms the Castle, defeating Talon to a bloody heap on the floor and drags Oria out screaming, leaving their new-born daughter, Oriana, with her beloved and now lifeless King, Sorvahr leaves Aina, having his prize in his arms, and marches victoriously back to Naschtok. His army stays awhile longer to further torture and bring terror to those of the blessed land, but eventually withdraws back to the stench of Naschtok. Talon is tended to by the great healers and makes a full recovery, though his heart remains crushed and torn by his loss. He bids his kinsmen to take Oriana away into the foothills of the Mighty Mountains of Lucienne, as she is their last hope. She's given the name of Nalí to disguise her true identity as the Princess of Aina, and proves over the years to possess an incredible power and beauty even beyond her mother's, the likes of which no one has ever seen before. Oria was taken back to Naschtom where she was raped by Toek again and again, and eventually bears him a son, given the name Syrius. He is raised to love destruction and war and hate the land and people of Aina, especially King Talon and the House of Ainaen. Oria is kept prisoner, barely able to keep her wits about her high above in the fortess of Naschtok. She is allowed out only to eat and to tutor Syrius, whom she loves despite the evil teachings of his father. She dreams of and longs for her land, her people, and her sweet Talon, mourning her loss of all of them. And on occasion, she is visited by Sorvahr, who whispers his cold desires in her ear and chills her to the bone. One day, Syrius is riding across the plains with a band of his sodiers when he comes to a lake at the foothills of Lucienne. There he sees a beautiful maiden bathing in the waters and bids her to come talk with him. The find much to say to one another, and make plans to meet the following day by the water. As their meetings continue, they grow fond of each other, each oblivious to the other's identity. Syrius finds a strange warmth growing in his chest where he only knows cold hardness, and the beautiful maiden feels confused by her feelings for this dark and mysterious taveler. Over time their meetings become more intense and the feel more and more of a connection between each other that neither fully comprehends, as though they were like souls destined for a like purpose. Finally, Syrius arrives late one evening, explaining that he's needed to make preperations for something monumental that is going to happen which will make him a powerful man indeed. A powerful man who needs a Queen to rule at his side. The maiden falls into his arms and they make love, and ever-darkening sky brooding above the,, and the tides of fate flowing their way. In the midst of this budding love, Sorvahr is planning another attack on Aina, as the Ainae are growing in strength and preperation for war against Naschtok. Messengers of the House of Ainaen are sent to the foothills of Lucienne, where it is announced that Nalí is needed to aid her father and people of Aina's last efforts for freedom to overcome the evil Sorvahr. Days before the armies of Naschtok are to march over the plains of Aina, Syrius goes to seek comfort in his love onle last time before they shall rule together. He fines, however, that she is not there and can find her nowhere. He is torn between the evil preparations of his father and sweetness and light he has known with his lovely maiden by the water. His mind is preoccupied and cunfused as he speeds back to his dark homeland to lead his father's forces to war on the land of the hated Aina, this time to rule completely and indefinitely occupy the land. Its people are ready for them, however, and led with a new hope in their hearts by the return and wonder of their Pricess Oriana, whose powers have grown to unimaginable strengths. As the armies of the House of Ainaen come to the borders of their land, headed by King Talon and the Princess Oriana, they meet oncoming Syrius and the demons of Naschtok. A confused Syrius sees his precious Nalí at the front of the defence of Aina and hals his company, holding up his hand in a token of parley. He suggests a meeting of leading commaders to perhaps come to a truce and seek some answers for his reeling mind. Sorvahr sees what is happening from afar and reaches his hand down out of the sky, crushing and killing his own son. His face appears in the swirling dark clouds, screaming to Oriana how dare she turn his own son away from him...and lover her own brother! Crouching down on the battlefield, cradling her dead love in her arms, who, she now realizes, was of her own blood, a sadness and wrath seals over her as she's never known before. A white light pours froth from her as she rises into the sky, singing a song of lament for all the people manipulated and attacked by the menace of Sorvahr. The purityof her own love and pity reached out across the distances to Naschtok, following the line of hate and dispair and destroying Sorvahr and all his evil.

There emerges from the rubble the fair Silver Maiden Oria Allyahan Ainaen. The family of the House of Ainaen is reunited and peace is restored. The people of Aina emerger better, stronger, and more beautiful and full of love then ever before. Oriana is forever haunted by the revelation of prosperity, becoming the greatest Queen in all time"

Sandy was the prettiest of all, She talked French, She came from Montreal. During chores she never had to help, Sandy got a bed all to herself. We slept in the trailer to the right, Sandy told us stories late at night. She spoke of ships and sailors, And the sea so big and wide, She had lots of uncles and was Always tired. Sandy, sandy, fishnets, fishnets, Washed up on the shore, What's she catching? And will she be sore? How they loved her in those early days, Mrs. Bolger let her go away, All the uncles drove her up to play, We would see them kissing on the lake. Time went by and Sandy's all grown up, The lines of uncles dwindled and the pirates stories stopped, Then one day Melissa May showed up, And Sandy had to share a bed with us. Sandy, sandy, fishnets, fishnets, Washed up on the shore, What's she catching? And will be soaring over the sea? The wind in her sails and a knife in her teeth, And the helm of a ship on it's way to a distant shore. The muted twilight, an uncharted island, Sandy we're all getting older, What will they do with us When they are through with us? Sandy, what are we sailing for? Christmas morning, 1993, Presents waiting underneath the tree, There's a box for me, a box for me, No gift for poor old Sandy to be seen. We found Sandy sobbing quietly, Uncle Gerald said he liked Christine, Mrs. Bolger said she'd have to leave, Three days later she was gone, The day she turned 13."

(it’s so incredible) North Korean barbeque Black clover Burn rain clouds burn Burn rain clouds burn  You know I wiped the blood out my blue eyes People looking at me thinking that I'm too high But no, I'm just saying goodbye, to the snow Waiting for the fireworks in July, here we go that's Something I can heart (whoa) Something I can heart (whoa) Something I can heart for life. (okay!) I'm looking for: Something I can heart (whoa) Something I can heart (whoa) Something I can heart for life. (okay!)  You know I'm rapping beautiful to drums I'm looking in the mirror asking who have you become? Me? I've become a monster, stone Hearted like a kid from the foster-homes But I ain't seen my home in months, I don't have the luxury I make my living on the road, can't say I'm living comfortably I'm looking in the mirror asking who the fuck is he? I dip my paintbrush in the blood that's on my upper teeth Damn, I'm a gluton for the self-torture Tell the devil thanks for punching me I fell forwards I only started screaming when I felt cornered At the record label meeting I could smell hors d'oeuvres They told me I should buy a new toupee They’ll put me on the charts I could climb, I’m to hooray Imma never let you do me like you do Lupe Keep your blood money bitch, good day!  Phoenix in the sky We will never die Sprinkling the ashes for the people in disguise Phoenix in the sky We will never die Sprinkling the happiness we need a new july  I'm like a classic impressionist painting With negative space covered by excellent shading I'm watching lots of these veterans fading Cause they ain’t sacrificing nothing to better what they brang And thats their own fault. Imma melt the snow with my bone salt Me and my stress can take a slow waltz Grab it by the hand, I throw it off a tall bridge, catch it if you can But you don't even want it. I separated from it Now I'm gonna live until I'm 1 million and 7 hundred So even when I die I’ll be chillin in heaven blunted (?) And probably hangin’ out with Jesus' children; forever young kid It's a quality of life, see now I got the juice And me and all my demons made a truce I promise it's a quality of life, and this anxiety is drug-induced So my sobriety will cut me loose, next!

You'll get no judgment from me I can only feel compassion And if that's what you need I will give you my compassion Just don't forget about me 'cause we all need some compassion  Open up your heart So you can start to feel compassion Get down on your knees Pray to heaven for compassion Everybody needs compassion If you want to be healed Then you know you got to feel compassion"

How can this even be real? How did I become a person that a loved one could kill? It wasn’t always this way I once saw love in those eyes That now just despise and chastise all my lies My sarcastic replies, each new drunken guise And worst of all these heavy hands that surmise my demise There was a time we never thought the honeymoon would end She was my wife, my lover, my confidant and my friend But it seems these days happiness can depend On financial stability and the need to contend But I make no excuse, I let it get the way Other people live their lives on the minimum wage I was the one that couldn’t cope and let it turn to rage Now I’m looking down the barrel playing guess the gauge For the bad times I cannot be acquitted or let off as the bullet enters my head And for the good times I wish for five minutes in heaven before the devil knows I’m dead For the bad times I cannot be acquitted or let off as the bullet enters my head And for the good times I wish for five minutes in heaven before the devil knows I’m dead  Before the devil knows I’m dead"

Groan with the ashes of lamentation In all grief-stricken mourning and bitter complaint Lucifer, Thou hast heard my hymn! Play on the zither of salvation & the harp of misery On the tabors of prayer and the pipe of praise without end!"

3392,Down,Jawbreaker,emo,3.08,5.87,This is the world Everyone's standing by hesitating So many people halfway there Why are you waiting? And all those things you thought you'd be Between two points in the middle of nowhere Did you know that it doesn't come free? Have you seen yourself of late? Have you really got your fill? Standing still beside the kill Never stop At times your feet they seem to slide Time to try for more than that That's the wonder of the winner's cup Never break your stride Get up! And if you slip you can get up Put your foot down Into the shaky ground See the people lying down Look around Piss around a circle and make it sound Can't you hear the sound of machines all breaking down Listen now The fuel is running out The severed lines destroyed by too much time spent down I come unwound My head forced down My hope forced down between my legs All my preaching stems from fear I hold you dear You must break out of this old cage You're my concern This is no longer safe.Do it now

I'm stranded on a ship of glass, which day will be my last? I toss and turn in my bed. an angel was lowered down from the clouds with pink wings and legs like a grasshopper; sixteen eyes in her head, trembling, screaming in a dead language. the captain locked the angel in a cage, then lightning crushed his skull with blinding rage One by one the crew fell sick with illness, while the angel was locked in imprisonment, my skin turned translucent, everyone could see my organs trembling like the gears of a clock. the first mate whose guts where stung with hunger tried one night to kill the strange angel, he turned into a hawk, with wings that peeled right off. we could not stand the sight of his crippled state, so we threw him overboard with blinding rage I can't sleep to save my life. all these dreams keep me up at night. see that black curtain coming for me, right now.... The cook and i were the only two alive. the cook lusted for the angel all day and night. the sky formed his face in stars, the face said do that angel no harm, but he touched her skin anyway. the next day the cook was not in his bed I heard him cry for help inside a mirror, where he was trapped for life, and he could never die, just watch all his friends slowly age, and beat against the glass with blinding rage I'm on my back watching clouds collide, all alone I know I surely will die. but before I expire, I untie the angels barbed wire and see land approach like a books last page—and take my last breath with blinding rage"

3409,A Skeleton Of Something More,Sleeping at Last,rock,7.015,4.405,"In the darkest of nights The city of lights Will pour unto us Creeping inside Through our sleepy eyes Contagiously bright Like sunlight and rain Flooding through the veins Of wilted vines But love travels like a rumor here Losing form with every ear A skeleton of something more But waking seems an awful dream We'll be waiting for the night Waiting for the night To come and rescue us Feet off the ground Besides, we're living in this house of cards That pulls and pushes with the air Fearing a feather to the earth Could destroy it and us Inside unaware! All we want is something more To dream about and to adore All we need is a little place To close our eyes, to end this chase The living are moving Gracefully And painfully rushing ahead While unraveling the most essential thread Of the fabric that covers us We'll be waiting for the night Waiting for the night To always come and rescue us Feet off the ground Our hearts become magnetized The warmth of the sun Is melting the snowflakes Before they hit the ground"

And I'm so tired of waiting Make tomorrow today You always talk of what you've done for me How about what I've done for you? I'm not the ruler of your destiny And it's high time you face the truth Make tomorrow today Anything you want You can have it now If you pull your head Out of the ground Everything you dream You can make come true The only one you fail To please is you Everything you dream You can make it be But you'll never live Your dreams through me

Tanti viaggi rimandati e già Valigie vuote da un'eternità... Quel dolore che non sai cos'è Solo lui non ti abbandonerà mai, oh mai! E' un rifugio quel malessere Troppa fretta in quel tuo crescere Non si fanno più miracoli Adesso non più Non dar retta a quelle bambole Non toccare quelle pillole Quella suora ha un bel carattere Ci sa fare con le anime Ti darei gli occhi miei Per vedere ciò che non vedi L'energia, l'allegria Per strapparti ancora sorrisi Dirti sì, sempre sì E riuscire a farti volare Dove vuoi, dove sai Senza più quel peso sul cuore Nasconderti le nuvole E quell'inverno che ti fa male Curarti le ferite e poi Qualche dente in più per mangiare E poi vederti ridere E poi vederti correre ancora Dimentica, c'è chi dimentica Distrattamente un fiore una domenica E poi... silenzi. E poi... silenzi Silenzi... Nei giardini che nessuno sa Si respira l'inutilità C'è rispetto e grande pulizia È quasi follia Non sai come è bello stringerti Ritrovarsi qui a difenderti E vestirti e pettinarti sì E sussurrarti non arrenderti Nei giardini che nessuno sa Quanta vita si trascina qua Solo acciacchi, piccole anemie Siamo niente senza fantasie (Pubblico)Sorreggili, aiutali Ti prego non lasciarli cadere Esili, fragili Non negargli un po' del tuo amore... Stelle che ora tacciono Ma daranno un senso a quel cielo Gli uomini non brillano Se non sono stelle anche loro Mani che ora tremano Perché il vento soffia più forte... Non lasciarli adesso no Che non li sorprenda la morte Siamo noi gli inabili Che pur avendo a volte non diamo Dimentica, c'è chi dimentica Distrattamente un fiore una domenica E poi... silenzi.

It’s been awhile I've had time to heal, but, leading up to that Um I think that I never really experienced any kind of any any real loss in my life None of my family ever passed away none of my, no one close to me And about a month later I lost someone very special to me So in love and death kind of became a more serious record than I thought and When we decided to do this acoustic show I hadn’t even looked at some of these songs For such a long time um! And it’s so powerful what you can capture and I think it’s so very Healing the power of music is um still unexplained and um anyways I'm so glad that For the rest of this set we’re gonna play some songs that we would never play and barely have played And everyone in here will or has lost someone I think that life is about learning and growing Beyond that, music has been my source of saving grace (I guess you would say) My god my religion so this song is about David Bowie Rest in fucking peace , it’s called All That I've Got So deep that it didn’t even bleed and catch me off guard Lead handed now I'm far from a lonely Asleep I see you still lying next to me So deep that it didn’t even bleed and catch me high I need something else with someone please just give me Knock me out and let me go back to sleep I can might fall I want, inside still feel empty So deep that it didn’t even bleed and catch me high  I'll be just fine pretending I'm not far from lonely and I'll be just fine pretending I'm not I'm far from lonely and All that I've got  I dance and remember every glance you shot I hide I'm losing it somebody here score’s too high Stop too high for me So deep that it didn’t even  I'll be just fine pretending I'm not far from lonely and I'll be just fine pretending I'm not I'm far from lonely and All that I've got You have that’s all that I've got It’s all that I've got All that I've got All that I've got All that I've got Till you cut me So deep that it didn’t even scream I'll be just fine,  I'm far from lonely and All that I've got  I'll be just fine pretending I'm not far from lonely and I'll be just fine pretending I'm not I'm far from lonely and All that I've got It’s all that I've got It’s all that I've got"

I'm scared of that, more than drugs. I'm not afraid of them.... . I'm just... I'm just scared you know? We're told that perhaps a million Americans, most of them young people, have made the LSD experience part of their lives. Is this a social menance and a cause for alarm? I don't think so. I see nothing less than the speedy evolution of a new, indigenous religion... I'm just... I'm just scared you know? Everybody is... pretty uptight... I'm just... I'm just scared... you know? The LSD religionist knows; that the temple of worship is the human body, that the shrine must be located, not in a public place, but in the privacy of your own home, and that the congregation cannot extend beyond your family and your closest friends... And then the paintings on the walls were dripping. You know...you could see the paint coming down like this, just like if somebody was hosing it off at the top and all the paint was running down onto the floor. And it was so pretty...they were running. Like they were melting! It was groovy... It was like a... it was like a massage. It was so... it was so groovy, you can't believe how groovy. It wasn't just water hitting you, taking a shower, soap and out you go, you know, towel off: It was just... oh wow! You know it was like... it was like... it was like a caress You know kind of... and you could really feel the hot and the cold. You could feel hot ""hot"" and cold ""cold"", you know and... and each little drop that came out was a different one, you know... it wasn't... I don't think the water must mix inside It must come out hot and cold or something, 'cos you could feel hot cold hot cold all over you. It was really groovy... I guess... it was...

Ifrån den stunden blev den kvinnan dubbelt hatad Hon hade lekt med dig, med oss ett litet slag Och tänkt jag kände det som även jag var ratad Jag ville slåss, och gick mot mitt livs nederlag Jag kom med hammaren beredd under kavajen När hon kom ut i sidenscarf och sa: God dag! Kom in och slå dig ner en stund så får vi prata! Jag bara stammade, nu minns jag inte vad... Och jag blev bjuden på likör och cigarreller Och kunde inte få mig till att säga nej! Och när vi skiljdes var vi bästisar och bundis Och jag tog saker som du glömt med hem till dig! Jag går omkring i mitt pompej, i bland ruiner Och jag trampar runt i resterna utav vårt liv Men du skall aldrig ge mig pikar om sekiner Och aldrig skall du bli en annans tidsfördriv! Nej, åt det gamla skall vi binda vackra kransar Och ta vårt liv och mina katter som de är Och trots all kärleksbrist och trasighet och fransar Dig skall jag älska livet ut, dig har jag kär!"

A little while ago, killing a few people here and there, mostly there. Saving the day for freedom and democracy in the Western Hemisphere once again, folks.  I was over there in the Dominican Republic entertaining the troops. I won't say which troops. Over there with a U.S.O. group including Walter Lippmann and Soupy Sales. I played there in a small coffeehouse called The Sniper, and this was my most unpopular song.

Ricordi o no? Dov'eri tu quel giorno? Te lo dirò… Cantavi nel coro più forte che mai Senza incrinature, adesso lo sai Con toni d'imperio la tua voce copriva La mia che una qualche incertezza tradiva Poi venne il giorno che dall'alto d'un balcone Ci s'intimò di scegliere tra il pane ed i cannoni: Se si fu fessi a tal punto da lasciare risposta al coro Poi lo fummo doppiamente… A non esigerli davvero Ora ch'è chiaro, lampante come il sole Che tutto quel drizzare di gobbe fu un'orgia di parole C'è ressa per offrire servizio a chi forza l'ha sul serio Puntuali come quei treni che arrivavano in orario Dov'eri tu quel giorno? Che è ieri poi… Dov'eri tu quel giorno? Puoi dirlo, vuoi? Su un nuovo spartito spalanchi la bocca Un ciclo è esaurito e sotto a chi tocca! Fratelli di ieri già oggi da odiare Ma ancora la spunta il più lesto a cantare… ""Ma io che forse tra i fessi ero il più fesso Qualcosa da ridire lo avrei di nuovo adesso: Ad accorrere festanti in soccorso a chi già vince Ci si mette addosso un gran brutto cencio Che nei secoli non stinge Non stinge… Non stinge…"""

Now, coming from me if you where to personally look at my life, you would ask the question ""What do you know, about a good father,"" and that would be a fair question, because.. one of The statements that I have written on my notes, here today, is that men need examples And that's not holy men, all of us, are helped by examples. But it does seem that As men we feel better, when other men show us that they are man enough to do Whatever it is that we have hesitancy in doing. Whether it is cook, sew maybe sit.. Or to shout, clap our hands, cry. We sometimes can't do it until we see other men Who have lost themselves in the praise of God and in life So, it would certainly be a fair question, on this Father's Day to ask ""What do you know about a good father?"" Now when I say father I am speaking of One who is the guardian or biological male in your life Who takes you out with them, who teaches you and gives you the instructions to follow Proverbs talks about the son or daughter following the instructions of the father Well certainly, there is no equivocation about that, that's wonderful, howe'er In order to follow ones instructions they most know what they're doing We ask, sociologically, why are there so many, messed up families, what's the problem?

No time! Now, I have got all the time In the world Say, honey, did you belong to me? Tell me, honey Was your heart at rest when, darlin All the mourning doves were howling us A song of love's Godawful lawlessness? Lawlessness Say, honey, did you belong to me? Tell me, honey, did I pass your test? I lay, as still as death, until the dawn Whereupon I wrested from Your godawful lawlessness. Lawlessness I roam around the tidy grounds Of my dappled sanatorium Coatless, I sit Amongst the motes, adrift And I dote upon my pinesap gum And the light, through the pines In brassy tines Lays over me, dim as rum And thick as molasses And so time passes And so, my heart, tomorrow comes I feel you, leaning Out back with the crickets Loyal heart marking the soon-ness Darkness: Tonight, still The mourning doves Will summon us their song Of love's neverdoneing lawlessness, lawlessness While, over and over — Rear up! Stand down! Lay round! — Trying to sound-out Or guess the reasons I sleep like a soldier, without rest But there is no treason Where there is only lawlessness. Lawlessness In the last week Of the last year I was aware I took a blind shot, across the creek At the black bear When he roused me in the night And left me cowering with my light Calling out Who is there? Who's there? Who is there? I watched you sleep Repeating my prayer (You give love a little shove And it becomes terror.) And now I am calling In a sadness beyond anger And beyond fear Who is there? Who's there? Who is there? I glare and nod Like the character, God Bearing down Upon the houses and lawns I knew a little bit But, darling, you were it And, darling, now it is long gone Sweetheart, in your clean, bright start — Back, there behind a hill, and a dell And a state line or two — I'll be thinking of you Yes, I'll be thinking And be wishing you well We land, I stand But I wait for the sound of the bell I have to catch a cab And my bags are at the carousel And then — Lord, just then — Time alone will only tell You mourning dove"

The light and fire that Split the sky still unhinged my soul, and fear Again within my mind took root. I asked the Fading Dynamo of the serpentine blaze which Seemed to hold a life apart from the Trinity, and Seemed stronger than their combined force. I Wondered aloud at the infernal flames that Wrapped like boiling vines about the clouds, and Illuminated them with an aethereal glow, and Shot down with all the speed of a blinking eye Lost in thought and trying to count seconds. I Was answered with the steady pulse, the rhythm Of the waves that spun slowly atop the dreamily Oozing altar within the sunken structure that had No beginning or cause, save the toil of an immor- Tall imagination. When I left the sea and the brine And the undulating waves, the slight glow and Shock still brushed against my flesh. I still could Feel the pull of the great unknown Dynamo."""

Than to constantly question the meaning of life? Eternally asking for answers to ""Why?"" What will become of us? Will we evolve? We seem to create more problems than we solve Will we be angels above endless sky? Or do we decay from the moment we die? Will we become slaves to machines we create? Will we succumb to our penchant for hate? Will we destroy our own genetic code? What will become of us years down the road? Can we undo the deal that we struck out of fear? Raping the globe, sobbing ""the end is near!""? Can we stand to look towards blinding light? Or will we extinguish it out of spite? Will we succeed reaching into deep space? And go extinct breeding with alien races? Is that how we already came to be? Martian DNA in our family tree? Why do we always ignore those in need? And keep selling out to insatiable greed? When we kill ourselves off, will all species join? Does their fate even rest on the flip if a coin? Or are we already collectively doomed? Walking-dead marching towards our final tomb? Even if we erase all the damage we've done Is there any hope left for us under the sun? For anyone who ever dared to ask why-- For Sweet Love of Planet Earth must we all die? We're already dead or never were alive This life's an illusion--it's all just a ride Why? Why? Why are we here in the first place to ask ourselves ""Why?"" Why? What is the purpose, and what is the prize? Is there some greater goal towards which to aspire? Do we exist just to fulfill desire? It's possible the reason we exist Is to give subtle texture to times endless mist It's possible, that we're only here To live, die, evaporate and disappear Nothing is permanent We're only here til we die There's no greater answer To any of life's questions why We're on our way out, we're going We're going to die There is no grand reason or purpose for being alive We're here til we're not, that's the end, that's the nature of life We're already dead if we don't realize this is life We may as well be dead if we don't accept this is life We're as good as dead because this is what we've done with life We've chosen to do nothing greater than this with our lives For Sweet Love of Planet Earth all human beings must die"

And in this song We find a way to follow all or none To accept these ends or defy them - But those notes hammer on... And when no one remembers where these Ships were built Or knows whether they found home Their legacy lives on in songs like this And when you sing this song Those lovers will dance And those truths will be found.. Those notes and cymbals And oceans and fingers will rise up again Though now, they fade Though now, they fade"

This flow created a dream in the young boys mind before he awoke. This dream was one filled with awareness, tragedy, and finally triumph. He saw his life as one day that lasted until the end of time. He knew that before the sun could make its way to its rightful place that he had to come to an agreement with chance. This agreement was one of awareness that his life was meant for something spectacular. He was chosen to dance in the flow of life. Everything was interconnected and that the sun was woven to his spirit and his spirit was woven to every other spirit in existence. This created a blanket that allowed him to dive without fear into the unknown and conquer the challenges that lay before him. He dreamed of broken stars and diamonds and what he saw filled his stomach with a cool brisk wind. It was as if wonder had been placed in his mind for the first time. His chest filled with air, up and down, as the night air blew through his blonde hair. He held a lasting thought of self worth and this thought brought destiny to his waking eyes.

Dad said ""We'll discuss it when they leave.""  So the Christians (Christians) and the Pagans (Pagans) sat together (Together) at the table Finding faith (Halle-) and common ground (Lujah) the best that (Halle-) they were able Lighting trees in darkness, learning new ways from the old And making sense of history and drawing warmth out of the cold"

Is everybody in? Is everybody in? The ceremony is about to begin Wake up! You can't remember where it was Had this dream stopped?

We're almost home We should see the gates by mornin' We should be inside by evening Sun, sun, sun Burn, burn, burn Burn, burn, burn I will get you Soon, soon, soon I am the lizard king I can do anything We came down The rivers and highways We came down from Forests and falls We came down from Carson and Springfield We came down from Phoenix enthralled And I can tell you The names of the Kingdom I can tell you The things that you know Listening for a fistful of silence Climbing valleys into the shade For seven years, I dwelt In the loose palace of exile Playing strange games with the girls of the island Now, I have come again To the land of the fair and the strong and the wise Brothers and sisters of the pale forest Children of night Who among you will run with the hunt? Now night arrives with her purple legion Retire now to your tents and to your dreams Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth I want to be ready"

There's more to this than just paying the rent If you're riding on this song you need to ride it to the end  What could you say as the Earth gets further and further away? Planets as small as balls of clay  Some shells get broke Some keep their wigs closed Some get exposed as little man big pose Some make moves and some stay daydreamers But everbody seems to want some loot, food and a beemer Well make mine hunter green with camel insides 10 percent tints, Mr. Pibb, and some french fries Inch by inch I take it closer to the shoulder But day by day it's getting harder to stay sober Once again on the edge, head's inebriated Movement needs motive, it's easier to be sedated What makes me mighty and another tiny? Why does my psyche give a damn about whether or not you like me? If this crime's right I might be wrong I grip this mic tight because it's all I really have a grip on So let the losers lose and let the players play The only difference is the day to some dust on the clay, what  Whose world is that? it ain't mine, and I'm grateful Already got a plate full of clay on my table I'm capable of handling fate, I know this So do the people that get pissed when this microphonist spits Too many get caught up in the lines that emcees thought up But it's clear to me the ones that fear me are the ones that oughta I spot a blemish on your planet's existence I deliver subtle terror submerged in clever sentences Instantly pissin' away the misfits The only residue that came of the hypothetical spew they sprayed When they swayed I'd have 'em Half of 'em can't fathom Where the maths from My man Beyond knows You can ask him At last, when we get down to it There's more than sand and fluid Involved in how I revolve and evolve Can we solve the secrets? No Can we take trinkets? No So when the ink hits it's more than just a sequenced flow I can't bring it with so I'm a leave me here Centuries from now they're gonna study Atmosphere Carefully I steer, I'm aware life is fatal When I go, I wanna go like hope, taken by the Plato "

Tenderness, affection, a true sense of love? Just pain through a body chock-full of regret  I'll keep on believing my life still has value And I'll keep on laughing Why can't I stop laughing? I can't stop the laughing"
