10,Vulture Horticulture,Shores of Elysium,metalcore,5.0,5.28,A single sunflower is all he could afford Who knew a simple garden could deter an undead hoard You'll reap the benefit while they photosynthesize They hunger for the organ setting right behind your eyes As the decomposing hoard Draws closer to your door The foul stench of the undead spewing bile from their pores Enough to make you heave They long to watch you bleed The switch was hit their feeble minds only tell them to feed These plants will not suffice Your brains set in their sights All you can do is watch and pray you'll make it through the night This is your last resort The fiends will be no more These vicious bombs you wield will send them to the morgue What once was dead now thrives again He deploys armies from his cold dead armored hands The zomboss lays your plans to waste He Consumes countless souls and smashes scouts within his hands Interested in intellects taste With the cruelest of intentions The dead were resurrected Miles of mindless minions march to munch upon your marrow Inclined to make you one of the infected

18,Autumn Perspective,Vanessa Daou,electronica,5.685,3.375,"Now, moving in, cartons on the floor The radio playing to bare walls Picture hooks left stranded In the unsoiled squares where paintings were And something reminding us This is like all other moving days; Finding the dirty ends of someone else's life Hair fallen in the sink, a peach pit And burned-out matches in the corner; Things not preserved, yet never swept away Like fragments of disturbing dreams We stumble on all day In ordering our lives, we will discard them Scrub clean the floorboards of this our home Lest refuse from the lives we did not lead Become, in some strange, frightening way, our own And we have plans that will not tolerate our fears A year laid out like rooms in a new house The dusty wine glasses rinsed off The vases filled, and bookshelves Sagging with heavy winter books Seeing the room always as it will be We are content to dust and wait We will return here from the dark and silent streets Arms full of books and food Anxious as we always are in winter And looking for the Good Life we have made I see myself then: tense, solemn In high-heeled shoes that pinch Not basking in the light of goals fulfilled But looking back to now and seeing A lazy, sunburned, sandaled girl In a bare room, full of promise And feeling envious Now we plan, postponing Pushing our lives forward into the future As if, when the room contains us and all our treasured junk We will have filled whatever gap it is that makes us wander Discontented from ourselves The room will not change: A rug, or armchair, or new coat of paint Won't make much difference; Our eyes are fickle But we remain the same beneath our suntans Pale, frightened Dreaming ourselves backward and forward in time Dreaming our dreaming selves I look forward and see myself look back"

I'll go underground, when the sun beats down I am back at the beginning, in the shadows upon my strike So the world have become silent, I can tell that this ain't no life I'm the man without shadow, I've got a stoneful of pillows There's no man in the mirror, just me and I hate what I see! All the things that are sad are saved inside my madness All I touch will die before the summer is gone All the blackest days will always flood my soul Inviting me to rest upon the leaves of autumn Searching for some kindness, lost inside my blindness I turn around, turn around From the underworld we arise On a string of bloodstained magnolias Relentlessly throwing the dice But there's no way we can get out of here In a time that see no end I'm building this cluster so sinister Of thoughts on love and death In a one man strong disaster In a dark tranquility Our hearts descend Aching from a bittersweet that'll never end A face with hollow eyes, A face with no more smiles The cold face of perdition, A voice silent cries The blind man, the rooster, the ultimate loser"

Why'd you have to break all my heart? Couldn't you have saved a minor part? I could have clipped and saved and planted in the garden Damn you guess I'll have to get a new one I'd love to sit and watch you drink With the reins to the world, gripping a smoke Vaguely missing link Don't ever change you hungry little bashful hound I got the sheep, poor little Bo Peep Has lost and filed for grounds But why'd you have to break all my heart I could have ripped apart and thrown into the river Wonder if there's hearts that will deliver Don't ever change, don't ever worry Because I'm coming back home tomorrow To 14th Street where I won't hurry And where I'll learn how to save, not just borrow And they'll be rainbows and we will finally know"

That was me Grass-stained shirt and dusty knees And I know things have gotta change They got pills to sell, they've got implants to put in, they've got implants to remove But I am not forgetting That I was a boy too And like the woods where I would creep, it's a secret I can keep Except when I'm tired, except when I'm being caught off guard I've had a lonesome awful day, the conversation finds its way To catching fire-flies out in the backyard And I tell the man I'm with about the other life I lived And I say now you're top gun, I have lost and you have won And he says, ""Oh no, no, can't you see When I was a girl, my mom and I we always talked And I picked flowers everywhere that I walked And I could always cry, now even when I'm alone I seldom do And I have lost some kindness But I was a girl too And you were just like me, and I was just like you"

My bishop and my knight will shatter his flanks And still I might feel God's heart in mine!"" And through confession's grille, Death's laughter was heard The knight cried, ""No, you've cheated me! But still I'll find a way, we'll meet once again And once again continue to play!"" They met within the woods, the knight, his squire, and friends And Death said, ""Now, the game shall end"" The final move was made, the knight hung his head And said, ""You've won, I've nothing left to play...""

Er niest und er ächzt und er schnaubt und er sprüht – Und dann wird es auch dem Minister zu dumm Er macht eine Pause Möcht' gern nach Hause Hält sich den Bauch – Und dann lässt er den Furz an der richtigen Stelle heraus! Und jetzt ist der Furz nicht mehr nur Geschwätz Sondern ein Gesetz! Zwar noch immer Scheiße, aber präzisiert Daher wird der Furz jetzt sauber registriert – Kommt in eine Mappe Mit einer schönen Klappe Und einer Nummer am Schurz Trifft auch ganz kurz Brüdergefurz Und kriegt einen Stempel Dem geht jeder auf den Leim – Nämlich das Wort ""Geheim""! Er kommt ins Parlament Dort wird er manchmal gerochen – Aber, impotent Wird über ihn debattiert! Dann sagt ein Redner: ""Hohes Haus Dieser Furz muss raus!"" Und das sind die richtigen Worte Die kriegen viel Applaus! Dann wird – Der Furz – Dem Volk - Geschenkt! ""Alles nichts wie Scheiße!""

Weil sie so bequem ist Weil sie kein Problem ist Schlucken wir sie ganz frei Furzen dabei Selber entzwei Was uns zum Menschen macht Anstatt nur zum Vieh – Das ist Demokratie!"""

The amaranth, the rose and the lily Buried within the glacial vault Of my thoughts Take from me this fading breath Enfold me in your veil of darkness To celebrate the reign of black eternal night And in the snows, glittering In the cold fragile moonlight Appeared the incandescent flowers... The blood of angels Said one of our round ""Our blood"" We dance... ...and the blowing of the winds is Our only music We dance Everlasting sleep... O solitude of death, where is the end of the strings? O coldness of the grave, where is the sound of dreams? Let us dance under the closed eyes of Paradise!

1344,"The Comet, The Course, The Tail",Peter Hammill,art rock,7.105,4.43,"They say we are endowed with Free Will - At least that justifies our need for indecision But between our instincts and the lust to kill We bow our heads in submission They say that no man is an island But then they say our castles are our homes; It's felt the choice is ours, between peace and violence... Oh, yes, we choose, alone? While the comet spreads its tail across the sky It nowhere near defines the course it flies Nor does it find its own direction Though the path of the comet be sure Its constitution is not So its meaning is possibly more Than the tracing of a tail In one brief shot at glory Love and peace and individuality So order and society are man-made? War and hate and dark depravity Or are we slaves? Channeling aggressive energies The Death Wish and the Will to survive Into finding and preserving enemies Is that the only way we know that we're alive? In the slaughterhouse all corpses smell the same Whether queens or pawns or innocents at the game; In the cemetery a uniform cloaks the graves Except for outward pomp and circumstance There is a time set in the calendar When all reason seems barely enough To sustain all the shooting stars: Times are rough I'm waiting for something to happen here It feels as though it's long overdue... Maybe a restatement of yesteryear Or something entirely new And the knowledge that we gain in part Always leads us closer to the very start And to the founding questions: How can I tell that the road signed to hell Doesn't lead up to heaven? What can I say when, in some obscure way I am my own direction?"

Lascio scorrere a fatica le giornate Strade, occhi, stringi bene i denti Per tacere la paura che hai nel cuore Non criticare gli altri prova a far di meglio tu Il vento delle tue mani mi passa dentro Tempesta nel mio mare tra ragione e sentimento Tra spirito e cuore c'è un'enorme differenza Il primo se lo perdi lo ritrovi...l'altro no! Dietro la tua cicatrice Che cosa c'è Una storia brutta o una felice? Bho..allora 10 piegamenti 10 piegamenti Dietro la tua cicatrice Non so che c'è Una storia brutta o una felice?

2036,Lost Rivers of London,Coil,electronic,4.32,3.55,"From Hubert Montague Crackanthorpe's Vignettes (1896):   I'm gonna drown myself in London's lost rivers I will walk down to the rain   I have sat there and seen the winter days finish their short-spanned lives; and all the globes of light  crimson, emerald, and pallid yellow  start, one by one, out of the russet fog that creeps up the river. But I like the place best on these hot summer nights, when the sky hangs thick with stifled colour, and the stars shine small and shyly. Then the pulse of the city is hushed, and the scales of the water flicker golden and oily under the watching regiment of lamps.   The bridge clasps its gaunt arms tight from bank to bank, and the shuffle of a retreating figure sounds loud and alone in the quiet. There, if you wait long enough, you will hear the long wail of the siren, that seems to tell of the anguish of London till a train hurries to throttle its dying note, roaring and rushing, thundering and blazing through the night, tossing its white crests of smoke, charging across the bridge into the dark country beyond.   In the wan, lingering light of the winter afternoon, the parks stood all deserted, sluggishly drowsing, so it seemed, with their spacious distances muffled in greyness: colourless, fabulous, blurred. One by one, through the damp misty air, looked the tall, stark, lifeless elms. Overhead there lowered a turbid sky, heavy-charged with an unclean yellow, and amid their ugly patches of dank and rotting bracken, a little mare picked her way noiselessly. The rumour of life seemed hushed. There was only the vague listless rhythm of the creaking saddle.   The daylight faded. A shroud of ghostly mist enveloped the earth, and up from the vaporous distance crept slowly the evening darkness. A sullen glow throbs overhead: golden will-o'-the-wisps are threading their shadowy ribbons above golden trees, and the dull, distant rumour of feverish London waits on the still night air. The lights of Hyde Park Corner blaze like some monster, gilded constellation, shaming the dingy stars. And across the east, there flares a sky-sign, a gaudy crimson arabesque. And all the air hangs draped in the mysterious sumptuous splendour of a murky London night.   I'm gonna drown myself in the lost rivers of London I am gonna drown myself in the lost rivers of London"

It turned my mind to Killers disguised as flies They are everywhere and follow me At the end of the false air It is the rainbow who lies Widdershins? Who cares! Backwards shut sparrows And Jhonn cracked his head until he bled Until he was dead I am however saved or unsaved Who cares about Nineveh or Edom? Or how I arranged their downfall As the Prehistoric Messiah? Rising over the drains is the beautiful flower Singing songs from the mango swamps When I built lotuses on the pedestal Of logos it manufactuered the robots That sniff and smell your dreams Can Cain culled the world with his butcher's knife And saved the top of the Universal Title? 2 Souls grow off twigs Black sticks with green smiles There are no other songs I have given Reese Witherspoon some conscious angel In the scullery I cleared out the dead last week I have set fire to the peg fairy's blood Whilst Pol Pot is in flames The keychain holds nothing severer than the will of the Queen When obsessiveness descends and hanging like goblins Let's safely say the mental bird has flown And the chickchickchickens are home to roost in the dead read house How many miles to hell for the weekend? Further than Pomtor? My sleeves are empty of telescope dead Whose eyes drawn carriages on the moon By 9, I only held one grudge Camera! Camera! White horses in Boomland!

Have I loosed arrows on the Patriarchs? The colour of apples is never seen As clearly as when they fall Like a Black Ship feast For the sake of the Queen I have rebuilt Atlantis Or was it Mu? Anyway the cement is made of snow there so I am told And the flowers all speak kitsch But Coptic cats run loose in the ruins They are screaming for release Chi-Rho, so we go To sleep in bluebell meadows Whilst the mighty tractors trundle by And create this great new world Ruled by black ships One shot from the book is enough to kill Two shots from the book is enough to kill And three shots kill/kill/kill Whilst the pangolins trill And the umbrellas erect Governance (Satanic) Over Gog And Magog"

2612,Origin Of Species,MC Frontalot,nerdcore,5.42,4.39," Congregation, settle in your seats The Reverend Front Aloud is on the mic and about to speak I’m about to freak you out, make you shiver in the pew While I’m delivering to you my sermon and divinity ensues Brought by the one true God. It’s a fact: Anybody else who ever had a God, their God’s wack We ain’t got to worry about ‘em; we picked the right horse You’re in the right house of worship (of course) And forces are gathering out in the world To diminish our faith in ways radical and thorough To discourage us from loving anything that’s immaterial To tempt our children with ever fruitier cereal And worst of all, to call us idiots while they do it My congregation, listen; I’m about to walk you through it We’re going to take the nation back from the heathens that’s within it We’re gonna get the most egregious of the atheists imprisoned Cause a schism while we’re at it, but emerge on top And once we’ve purified our ranks we won’t stop — We’ll purify your minds of what’s illegitimately thought It’s not to be a battle indiscriminately fought But an orchestrated effort, and I’m gonna need you to commit Might take a couple generations for this deviltry to quit Start with the kids — in fact, they get distracted from the Lord — So I’d like you to write a couple letters to your school board Do you, do you really believe That we were nothing but them monkeys swinging up in the trees? Don’t it seem a little likelier that Adam and Eve Did a lot of humping, and that was the origin of the species?  And what has this so-called science ever done for us But trumpeted that when ashes go to ashes & dust to dust Despite the fuss of living, energy gets conserved Denying the weight of the soul of a man: this is ill deserved This is still the curse of Copernicus that we suffer Secular thought ought not to overflow its buffer And run roughshod through the minds of you, the population Heretics such as Dawkins and Sagan overstep their station To say that what we see and what we believe should be confluent Look to your Reverend to end apostasy — that’s what I’m doing! Look to your Holy Book to light the way; that is its purpose Open it up and you’ll find Eden ‘fore you even scratch the surface And sure, this should be mirrored in the textbooks verbatim But I’m not in a position yet to issue ultimatum So I lay down my scheme: we’ll make it seem as though creation Isn’t anything we’d like to interject to education We’ll wrangle up the language: science, data, theorem The irreducible complexity of the ears we use to hear ‘em Gnashing teeth and wailing from Kansas to PA Yes, my flock, I talk of futures not imminent but underway Already established an Institute for Discovery Discovered that Darwin is dead with outlook grim for recovery Schoolmarms will soon say that he burns in a fiery sea Think how much like paradise that’s gonna be Do you, do you really believe That we were nothing but them monkeys swinging up in the trees? Don't it seem a little likelier that Adam and Eve Did a lot of humping, and that was the origin of the species?"
